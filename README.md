# Climate Analysis

## Overview

In this assignment, you'll analyze and explore climate data for Honolulu, Hawaii. Using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, you'll perform a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database provided.

### Analyze and Explore the Climate Data:

#### Steps
##### Connect to the SQLite database:
* Use the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to the provided SQLite database (hawaii.sqlite).
##### Reflect the tables into classes:
* Use the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect the tables into classes named station and measurement.
##### Create a session:
* Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.
##### Perform a precipitation analysis:
* Find the most recent date in the dataset.
* Get the previous 12 months of precipitation data.
* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and plot the results.
* Print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.
##### Perform a station analysis:
* Calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.
* Find the most active station (i.e., the station with the most rows) and its observation counts.
* Calculate the lowest, highest, and average temperatures for the most active station.
* Get the previous 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) data for the most active station and plot the results as a histogram.
##### Close the session.
